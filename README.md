# Blinkit Sales Performance Analysis

## 📄 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. The goal is to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization using various KPIs and visualizations in Python.

## 🎯 Objectives
The primary objective is to analyze the data to understand:
* **Sales Performance:** The impact of fat content, item type, and outlet establishment type on total sales.
* **Customer Satisfaction:** How average ratings vary across different products and categories.
* **Inventory Distribution:** The relationship between outlet size, location, and sales performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python:** Core language for data analysis.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and aggregation.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating static visualizations (Bar charts, Donut charts, Line plots).

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Based on the analysis of **8,523** items, the following high-level metrics were established:

* **Total Sales:** $1.2 Million
* **Average Sales:** $141.0
* **Number of Items Sold:** 8,523
* **Average Rating:** 4.0

## 📈 Insights & Visualizations

### 1. Sales Distribution by Fat Content
* **Insight:** **Low Fat** items generate significantly higher revenue compared to Regular items.
* **Metric:** Low Fat items account for **64.6%** of total sales, while Regular items contribute **35.4%**.

### 2. Top Performing Item Types
* **Insight:** The "Fruits and Vegetables" and "Snack Foods" categories are the top revenue drivers.
* **Metric:** Both categories consistently show high sales volume (~$178k and ~$175k respectively), whereas "Seafood" and "Breakfast" items show the lowest sales performance.

### 3. Impact of Outlet Size
* **Insight:** **Medium-sized** outlets are the most profitable, followed closely by Small outlets. High-size outlets contribute the least to total revenue.
* **Metric:** Medium outlets account for **42.3%** of sales, compared to just **20.7%** for High-size outlets.

### 4. Outlet Location Analysis
* **Insight:** **Tier 3** locations are the highest grossing outlet types, significantly outperforming Tier 1 and Tier 2.
* **Metric:** Tier 3 stores show a dominant performance in total sales volume across both Low Fat and Regular item categories.

### 5. Historical Sales Trend (Outlet Establishment)
* **Insight:** Older establishments (founded in 1998) show high historical performance. There is a noticeable dip in sales for outlets established around 2011, followed by a stabilization in recent years.
* **Metric:** Peak sales were observed for outlets established in 1998 (~$204k), while 1998-2009 remains a strong period for establishment performance.

## 📝 Conclusion
The analysis indicates that Blinkit's revenue is heavily driven by **Low Fat** products and **Medium-sized** outlets in **Tier 3** locations. To maximize revenue, inventory optimization should focus on high-performing categories like Fruits, Vegetables, and Snacks, while strategies should be developed to uplift underperforming High-size outlets and Tier 1 locations.
